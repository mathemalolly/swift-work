== Simple bash cases with file dependencies

=== S1

This case just illustrates how to call a shell script from Swift/T.

----
$ swift-t s1.swift 
command.sh /dev/null newfile.txt
----

Note that input() tells Swift/T that the file is an input file and
already exists.

=== S2

This case shows how to set up file dependencies from Swift/T.

* The flag -l prepends rank numbers to the output.
* The flag -n 3 provides 2 workers, 1 Swift/T server. +
  (The default is -n 2 , 1 worker, 1 server.)

As shown, files b and c are created concurrently on different ranks,
creating a diamond dataflow pattern.

----
$ swift-t -l -n 3 s2.swift
[1] command.sh /dev/null -- a.txt         #    A
[1] command.sh a.txt -- c.txt             #   C \
[0] command.sh a.txt -- b.txt             #    \ B 
[0] command.sh b.txt c.txt -- d.txt       #     D
