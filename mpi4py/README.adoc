C-Python stuff is in py.c, copied from
https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/Supervisor/tree/master/scratch/py-eval

== Setup

Edit setup.sh:

. Set SPACK
. Set HASH locations for each package

(Could have used 'spack load' but this is more fundamental.)

== Test summary

test-1:: (C&#8203;) Plain use of py.c

test-2:: (C&#8203;) Use of mpi4py from py.c .  Requires mpi4py built from
source, so use Spack for Python and mpi4py and MPI.

test-3:: (C,Python) Use of constructed communicator in mpi4py

test-4:: (Swift) Plain use of python()

test-5:: (Swift) 'import mpi4py' from Swift/T

test-6:: (Swift) Use of constructed communicator from Swift
