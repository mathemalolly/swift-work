WLM: Workflow Lock Manager

WLMPY: Workflow Lock Manager Python Interface

== Idea

Sets up a special rank, the *manager*.  To acquire the lock, a client sends an MPI message to the manager and receives a response.  Since the manager is single threaded, and blocks while waiting for the client to release the lock, only one rank will have the lock at a time.

== File index

lock-mgr.[ch]::
The core C/MPI functionality

wlm.i::
The SWIG interface file

log.[ch]::
Logging features for WLM

profile.[ch]::
Profiling features for WLM

time_double.h::
Just to get the time in a consistent way

=== Tests

Run the Python tests with run-py.sh and the Swift/T tests with run-swift.sh
